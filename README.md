# Divide-Conquer
A Divide and Conquer solution for the bed matching problem in my Algorithm Design course.

Problem description: "Suppose we are running a bed manufacturing company. There are several different types of beds of various
dimensions (length and width) that we can produce. To decide which beds we should produce, we run
a market survey asking people what dimensions they require in a bed (i.e. the minimum length and
the minimum width they need). We say that a person is compatible with a bed type if its length is
at least that person’s length requirement, and its width is at least that person’s width requirement.
The compatibility of a bed type is the number of persons compatible with it. Our goal is to determine
efficiently the compatibility of every bed type."
